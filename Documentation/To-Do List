## To-Do List ##
#  - create script to update scripts. will need ability to skip update if it will break functionality of existing scripts. plus ability to keep existing user variables.

#  - option to backup vdisks using full paths. will resolve issues with unique names.
#  - set config (xml) and nvram (fd) files to pull extensions programmatically to prevent future issues.
#  - change how files are deleted when number_of_backups_to_keep is being used. possibly use a list before removing files?
