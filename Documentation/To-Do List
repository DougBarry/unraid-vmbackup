## To-Do List ##
#  - create script to update scripts. will need ability to skip update if it will break functionality of existing scripts. plus ability to keep existing user variables.
#  - possible to make into a plugin?
#  - option to backup vdisks using full paths. will resolve issues with unique names.
#  - improve efficiency especially as it relates to creating extra $vm.xml files and loops.
#  - create functions to reduce file length and increase readability.
#  - set config (xml) and nvram (fd) files to pull extensions programmatically to prevent future issues.
#  - change how files are deleted when number_of_backups_to_keep is being used. possibly use a list before removing files?
#  - test case where vdisk1 does not exist.
#  - use different backup source disk when snapshots are enabled to speed up overall backup times. give option for rsync and cp?
#  - fail if snapshot isn't able to be performed.
#  - option to revert back to traditional backup if snapshot fails.
