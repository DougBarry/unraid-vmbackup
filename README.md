# unraid-vmbackup

Script for use with user scripts plugin on unRAID.

Currently the script is kind of a work in progress, and not all features are implemented. Please review the Change Log and To-Do List as they contain important information about the current state of the script.


I will flesh this readme out with instructions and functionality as more features are added.
