## Change Log ##

# v1.0.0 - 2018/03/13
#  initial release
#
#  includes features from original as well as:
#  - Uses cp for initial sync because it is quicker than rsync and has the added bonus (at least in my testing) of creating smaller sparse files than rsync does.
#  - Keeps one copy of each vdisk to offset risk of using --inplace with rsync.
#  - Uses rsync for syncing changes to backups.
#  - Corrected some logging errors.
#  - Temporarily disabled keeping backups for a set number of days.
#  - Changed default check from 60 seconds to 30 seconds and doubled number of allowed failures.
#  - VMs are now started after backup if they were running before the backup was started.
